### Idea is to ask the user a bunch of questions ###
### If they get an answer correct, we add 1 point to their score ###
### At the end of the program, we'll print out what their score was out of the total ###

### Welcome screen ###
print("Welcome to my computer quiz!")

playing = input("Do you want to play? ")
if playing.lower() != "yes":
	quit()

print("Okay! Let's play.")

counter = 0
total = 0

### Question 1 ###
answer = input("What does CPU stand for? ")
if answer.lower() == "central processing unit":
	print("Correct!")
	counter = counter + 1
	total = total + 1
else:
	print("Incorrect!")
	total = total + 1

### Question 2 ###
answer = input("What does RAM stand for? ")
if answer.lower() == "random access memory":
	print("Correct!")
	counter = counter + 1
	total = total + 1
else:
	print("Incorrect!")
	total = total + 1

### Question 3 ###
answer = input("What does GPU stand for? ")
if answer.lower() == "graphics processing unit":
	print("Correct!")
	counter = counter + 1
	total = total + 1
else:
	print("Incorrect!")
	total = total + 1

### Question 4 ###
answer = input("What does PSU stand for? ")
if answer.lower() == "power supply unit":
	print("Correct!")
	counter = counter + 1
	total = total + 1
else:
	print("Incorrect!")
	total = total + 1

### Question 5 ###
answer = input("What does USB stand for? ")
if answer.lower() == "universal serial bus":
	print("Correct!")
	counter = counter + 1
	total = total + 1
else:
	print("Incorrect!")
	total = total + 1

grade = (counter / total) * 100

print("You got " + str(grade) + " % correct.")

if grade <= 60:
	print("You have failed this quiz. Please try again.")
else:
	print("Congratulations! You have passed the quiz.")
